## About The Project

FreelancingPortal is designed to provide a complete digital marketplace for freelance work.

Clients can create and publish projects, receive competitive bids from Developers, review proposals, and hire suitable Developers.

Developers can discover available projects, submit bids using tokens, track their bids, and work on assigned projects.

Admins can manage users, monitor projects, moderate platform activities, and handle account-related actions.

## Authentication & User Roles

FreelancingPortal uses secure token-based authentication with JWT.

The platform supports three different user roles:

- **Admin** – Manages users, projects, moderation, and platform activities.
- **Client** – Creates projects, receives bids, reviews developers, and hires developers.
- **Developer** – Browses projects, submits bids, manages bids, and works on assigned projects.

## Token-Based Bidding System

FreelancingPortal uses a token-based bidding system to manage competitive project bids.

- Developers use tokens to submit bids on projects.
- Token balance is validated before placing a bid.
- MongoDB atomic `$inc` operations are used for token balance updates.
- Atomic operations help prevent incorrect token deductions during simultaneous bid submissions.
- The system maintains consistent token balances even when multiple users submit bids concurrently.

## Concurrency-Safe Bid Acceptance

FreelancingPortal uses concurrency-safe logic when a Client accepts a Developer bid.

- Conditional `findOneAndUpdate` queries are used during bid acceptance.
- The project is assigned to only one Developer.
- Once a bid is accepted, other pending bids are automatically rejected.
- Conditional database updates help prevent multiple Developers from being assigned to the same project during simultaneous requests.
- This ensures consistent project and bidding state under concurrent operations.

## Real-Time Notifications

FreelancingPortal provides in-app notifications to keep users updated about important platform activities.

The system supports notifications for the following events:

1. Bid Received
2. Bid Accepted
3. Bid Rejected
4. Project Assigned
5. Account Blocked

These notifications help Clients, Developers, and Admins stay informed about important changes without manually checking every section of the platform.

## Wallet & Token Package System

FreelancingPortal provides a token-based wallet system for Developers.

- Developers can maintain a token balance in their wallet.
- Tokens are required to submit project bids.
- Token balance is validated before placing a bid.
- Developers can purchase token packages to increase their available bidding balance.
- Token transactions are handled through backend validation and database operations.
- The wallet system supports the platform's competitive bidding workflow.


## Security Features

FreelancingPortal implements multiple security mechanisms to protect user accounts, APIs, and platform workflows.

- JWT-based authentication for protected routes
- bcrypt password hashing
- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- Protected Admin, Client, and Developer workflows
- Authenticated REST API endpoints
- Token balance validation before bidding
- Atomic MongoDB operations for safe token updates
- Conditional database updates for concurrency-safe bid acceptance
- User account blocking and moderation through Admin controls
